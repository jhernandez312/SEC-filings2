Tech Stack:
Front end:
Flask, html, javascript

Back end:
Python

Flask provided a straightforward way to develop a visualization with a python backend and I've used html before and buttons are quick to make.

You can use any valid ticker/cik and it will analyze the 10-K filings from 1995 - 2023 (if available).

For the insight, I chose to analyze section 7 because it changed the most from year to year. It also provides lots of insights on revenue and buisness model.
